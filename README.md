# Simple Invoice Generator

A simple invoice generator using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org).
A YAML data file is used to configure the output of the resulting pdf.
Scroll to the bottom for example invoices.

## Data File

A `data.yml` file is required to configure the output of the resulting pdf.
An example data file is shown in [`data.example.yml`](data.example.yml).
All keys are detailed below.
Unless specified otherwise, values are treated as raw strings.
Note that the YAML file must be properly terminated (`---` at the end of the file) otherwise pandoc will have trouble loading it.

```yaml
fonts_path: '/home/user/repos/simple-invoice-generator/fonts'
font: 'OpenSans'
fontsize: '10pt'
geometry: 'left=20mm,right=20mm,top=20mm,bottom=20mm'
```

`fonts_path` should generally be the path to the `fonts` directory in this repo.

`font` must be one of:

```
Barlow
FiraSans
Hind
HindMadurai
HindSiliguri
Kanit
Lato
MontserratAlternates
Mukta
NanumGothic
Oxygen

PTSans
Sarabun
Tajawal
TitilliumWeb

`fontsize` can be any valid font size that can be read by `\documentclass` in LaTeX.

`geometry` can be any valid geometry configuration that can be read by `\geometry` in LaTeX.

```yaml

```

`invoice-number` is the invoice number in string format.

      rate: 10.00
  - description: 'Used Anton'
    hourly:
      hours: 10.5
      rate: 100.00
  - description: 'Bonus'
    other:
      price: 100.00
  - description: 'Expense \#1'
    other:
      price: 1000.00
      details: 'Acquired equipment (attached invoice with number 123456789)'
  - description: 'Expense \#2'
    other:
      price: 10.00
      details: 'Ate pizza (receipt attached)'
  - description: 'Expense \#3'
    other:

      details: 'Travelled to conference (receipts attached)'
```

`services` is a list of maps detailing the services / goods the invoice is for.

`services[].description` is a description of the service / good provided.

`services[].hourly` is a map requiring two keys: `hours` and `rate`.
The values of both keys must be numbers.
This should be used to describe hourly services; the total will be calculated automatically.
A note will be added under the service description stating the amount of hours worked and the agreed upon rate.
`services[].hourly` takes precedence over `services[].other`.

`services[].other` is a map requiring one key (`price`), with another key (`details`) being optional.
`services[].other.price` is the cost of the service / good provided.
Must be a number.
`services[].other.details` is optional and is added under the service description when provided.
`services[].hourly` takes precedence over `services[].other`.

## Running

Assuming `data.yml` is in the current directory and `fonts_path` is configured as described above:

```sh
pandoc ./data.yml --template=/home/user/repos/simple-invoice-generator/template.tex --output=invoice.pdf --verbose --pdf-engine=xelatex
```

This should output `invoice.pdf` in the current directory.
